/// Swapchain handling a fixed set of re-usable buffers e.g. for scan-out.
///
/// ## How am I supposed to use this?
///
/// To do proper buffer management, most compositors do so called double-buffering.
/// Which means you use two buffers, one that is currently presented (the front buffer)
/// and one that is currently rendered to (the back buffer). After each rendering operation
/// you swap the buffers around, the old front buffer becomes the new back buffer, while
/// the new front buffer is displayed to the user. This avoids showing the user rendering
/// artifacts doing rendering.
///
/// There are also reasons to do triple-buffering, e.g. if you swap operation takes a
/// unspecified amount of time. In that case you have one buffer, that is currently
/// displayed, one that is done drawing and about to be swapped in and another one,
/// which you can use to render currently.
///
/// Re-using and managing these buffers becomes increasingly complex the more buffers you
/// introduce, which is where `Swapchain` comes into play.
///
/// `Swapchain` allocates buffers for you and transparently re-created them, e.g. when resizing.
/// All you tell the swapchain is: *"Give me the next free buffer"* (by calling [`acquire`](Swapchain::acquire)).
/// You then hold on to the returned buffer during rendering and swapping and free it once it is displayed.
/// Efficient re-use of the buffers is done by the swapchain.
///
/// If you have associated resources for each buffer, that can also be re-used (e.g. framebuffer Handles for a `DrmDevice`),
/// you can store then in the buffer slots userdata, where it gets freed, if the buffer gets allocated, but
/// is still valid, if the buffer was just re-used. So instead of creating a framebuffer handle for each new
/// buffer, you can skip creation, if the userdata already contains a framebuffer handle.
